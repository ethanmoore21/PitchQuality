This repository contains 3 files. 

qop_3_rfs.R is the first chronologically and stands for "Quality of Pitch 3, Random Forests." This is the script fully laid out in the following article 

https://towardsdatascience.com/revamping-my-pitch-quality-metric-66cb2dbe8d8a

qop2020_improved.R contains only slight changes to the first script and is meant to update the analysis done by the original since the 2020 MLB season ended. This script will probably not be very useful to you.

xRV3_2021.R is the third and final update to this project. It contains a few substantial changes and is the final result of this project. 

Hopefully you enjoy this work and find it helpful. If you have any questions, please reach out to me on twitter @Moore_Stats.
